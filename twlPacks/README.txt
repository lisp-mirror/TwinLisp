 This TwinLisp implementation works on top of clisp. So, the program is called 'tlisp', from TwinLisp+CLisp.

 INSTALLATION NOTES:

 It is assumed, that you have clisp installed already.
 To install the thing, you have to execute in *this* directory shell command:
   clisp install.lisp

 USAGE:

 tlisp -h   --- provides info about available options and ways to use tlisp.
 tclisp     --- starts clisp with two syntaxes. TL syntax is ON by default.
